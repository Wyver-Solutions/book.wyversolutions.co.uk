My general advice to anyone working in a technological field is to use your networks, and develop a set of trusted sources for information that you can tap into.

If you're new to this, I'd recommend Harold Jarche's [Seek, Sense, Share framework](http://jarche.com/2014/02/the-seek-sense-share-framework/):

>  ... a framework for individuals to take control of their professional development through a continuous process of seeking, sensing-making, and sharing.

> **Seeking** is finding things out and keeping up to date. Building a network of colleagues is helpful in this regard. It not only allows us to “pull” information, but also have it “pushed” to us by trusted sources. Good curators are valued members of knowledge networks.

> **Sensing** is how we personalize information and use it. Sensing includes reflection and putting into practice what we have learned. Often it requires experimentation, as we learn best by doing.

> **Sharing** includes exchanging resources, ideas, and experiences with our networks as well as collaborating with our colleagues.
