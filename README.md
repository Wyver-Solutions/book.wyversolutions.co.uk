This book(let) is aimed at generalists like me. You have an insatiable curiosity about the workings of organisations, machines and systems. You're the sort of person who can't easily be put into a box, or defined by a job title.

You want to make things better.

You want to help people understand each other.

The "wisdom" contained in these few pages will hopefully help you along that journey.

I've decided to split things up into four generic topic areas - each of which has played a key part in my career so far.

- People: How to best communicate complex ideas in complex organisations
- Products: How to create something that other people will want to use
- Processes: How to explore and explain the way things need to work
- Projects: How to get the best out of people building products to support processes
