title: Introduction
---

This book(let) is aimed at generalists like me.

You have an insatiable curiosity about the workings of organisations, machines and systems.

You're the sort of person who can't easily be put into a box, or defined by a job title.

You want to make things better.

The "wisdom" contained in these few pages will hopefully help you along that journey.

I've decided to split things up into four generic topic areas - each of which has played a key part in my career so far.

- **People**: How to best communicate complex ideas in complex organisations
- **Products**: How to create something that other people will want to use
- **Processes**: How to explore and explain the way things need to work
- **Projects**: How to get the best out of people building products to support processes

You'll probably wonder why I've left out any mention of technology... That's because this changes so fast that anything I write now is likely to be out-of-date by the time the book gets published.

My general advice to anyone working in a technological field is to use your networks, and develop a set of trusted sources for information that you can tap into.

If you're new to this, I'd recommend Harold Jarche's [Seek, Sense, Share framework](http://jarche.com/2014/02/the-seek-sense-share-framework/):

>  ... a framework for individuals to take control of their professional development through a continuous process of seeking, sensing-making, and sharing.

> **Seeking** is finding things out and keeping up to date. Building a network of colleagues is helpful in this regard. It not only allows us to “pull” information, but also have it “pushed” to us by trusted sources. Good curators are valued members of knowledge networks.

> **Sensing** is how we personalize information and use it. Sensing includes reflection and putting into practice what we have learned. Often it requires experimentation, as we learn best by doing.

> **Sharing** includes exchanging resources, ideas, and experiences with our networks as well as collaborating with our colleagues.
